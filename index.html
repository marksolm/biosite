     <h3>I am called younan ( Jonah ), because I was born in Jonah`s celebration according to Egyptian Coptic calendar .
      My family contained five members. I was the second member among my brothers. I grew up at a house which is full of love and sanctification. After some years I have met a nice, lovely girl. When I saw her, I decided to marry her. I got married at age of thirty. After that, I have got my two daughters who bring joy and happiness to our home. 
     </h3><br />
     <h2 id="During_my_school">During my school</h2>
      <p>At school I had met new friends who were clever too. We were in competitions in studies and sports. I have studied hard during high school and I succeeded to attend a good university. I had studied languages both English and German. I studied hard and got high marks at my studies. </p>
       <br />
     <h2 id="What_I_do">What I do</h2>
      <p>I tried to work in my college as a teacher, but there was no chance to work there for some reason. I have moved to another city to look for work, and I worked at a famous hotel as a receptionist. My work remained for some months then I worked as a tourist guide. After that, I opened my very first own shop which was offering jewelry to tourists. Then I got my second shop in which I sold papyrus.<span class="sentence">I had to read much about old ancient Egyptian history to explain any <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Egyptian_Papyrus/" target="_blank"> Papyrus </a> picture. It is interesting to know ancient Egyptian history."</span> Life is interesting when you have a good family, and you achieve yourself.</p>
